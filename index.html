            <p>
                My professional career life starting when I was 10 when my brother and I 
                started working a paper route to make enough money to buy a GameCube for ourselves. 
                Since then I've gone to school for Culinary Arts, worked in 4 different restaurants 
                over 5 years with all sorts of roles. I am currently employwed as a Customer Success Manager 
                for Instructure where I have thoroughly enjoyed the tech field.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a love for efficiency, utilizing many keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys 
                and maintaining a high standard of quality in my work with a sharp eye for detail.
